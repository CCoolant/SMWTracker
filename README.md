# SMWTracker
A tool for tracking completed exits and collected Dragon Coins in Super Mario World. Created for use in https://archipelago.gg/ runs.

# How to Use
Upon opening, each level will be marked with a red square. Clicking the squares will change their color or may label them with a coin.

If a level contains a single exit and dragon coins it can be toggled between red for incomplete, green for complete, and green with a coin for completed with coins collected.

For levels with multiple exits, a yellow color indicates partial exit completion.

Switch palaces simply toggle between green and red.
